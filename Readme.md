# Git Workflow with Screenshots

## Step 1: Initial Setup
In this step, we created a folder called `learn_git` and initialized an empty Git repository inside it. 
We also created the `third.txt` file, added it to the staging area, and committed it to Git.

## Step 4: Configuring Git
We configured Git to use `cat` as the pager, which makes it easier to view logs and commands. Then we pushed the changes to the remote repository on GitHub.
